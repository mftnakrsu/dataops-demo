# Dataops Demo

## Overview
This repository contains a data science project that focuses on [.......]. The main goal is to [.......]. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model building.

## Project Description
In this project, I explore [...]. The dataset includes [..] and the primary objective is to [....]. The steps followed in this project are:
1. **Data Collection**: ....
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
4. **Modeling**: Building machine learning models to [...].
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as .....].

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
  - [....]
